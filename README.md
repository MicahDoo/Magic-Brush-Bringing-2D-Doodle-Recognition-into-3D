# Magic Brush: Bringing Sketch Recognition To 3D
An Investigation into 3D Freehand Doodle Recognition with Object Generation and its Application in VR Gaming

## Introduction

Picture this: a brush that wields the power of creation. With a flick of your wrist, you can sketch any object in any shape, any size and any orientation your heart desires, and with a snap of your fingers, your creation springs to life, a real-life object that matches your vision in every way: shape, size and orientation. In this project, I present to you the Magic Brush: a brand-new game mechanic that brings this fantastical concept to life in the Virtual Reality world.

## Motivation

When I was brainstorming ideas for a Virtual Reality game I wanted to make for my undergrad capstone project, I was hit with a flurry of ideas that run the gamut from rollercoasters to optical illusions. Some of those are real-word experiences that would be cool to recreate in a virtual environment, but the ones that really intrigue me are those that allow people in a headset to be able to experience what cannot happen in the world as we know it today. A game where the player navigates through a 3D Maze by manipulating the direction of gravity would be a cool one, so that I made. But I couldn't help but think: Is it cool? Yes. Fun? Sure. Challenging? No. Not for the game developer. A few other ideas came along the way, like portals, etc. but the one thing that really clicked was a brand new game mechanic where the player can have a tool ready just by drawing it by hand. Imagine the possibilities. Need to cross a river? Draw a ladder long enough and use it as a bridge. Can't reach a zipline? Draw a long hook to catch it. The idea stuck like glue and soon became the driving force behind my project.
